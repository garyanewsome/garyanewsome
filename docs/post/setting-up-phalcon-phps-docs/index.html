<p>I recently made my first open source contribution to the PhalconPHP docs. It was a small contribution, but nevertheless it felt nice, and it was a great way to start being an open source contributor. This post is basically just to document my experience setting up the <code>docs</code> and the <code>docs-app</code> for <a href="https://phalconphp.com/">PhalconPHP</a>. <em>To note, I am using 2015 MacBookPro running macOS Sierra</em>.</p>

<p>I started by following the setup guide at <a href="https://blog.phalconphp.com/post/helping-with-documentation">https://blog.phalconphp.com/post/helping-with-documentation</a>. Which worked really well and it got me close, but there were a few tweaks I needed to make to get things running on my end.</p>

<p>The main difference between the conventional setup and the way I did it was, not using Nanobox to serve the <code>docs-app</code>. I tried a couple of times, but it just wasn&rsquo;t working out for me. <em>I did use it for the deploy step though.</em> What I did, with the help of friend, boss, and Phalcon core team member <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulSCoder">Paul Scarrone</a>, was install <a href="https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools">phalcon-devtools</a> instead. This allowed me to run the app via a local development server instead.</p>

<p>So, onto the good stuff.</p>

<h5 id="installing-phalcon-devtools">Installing Phalcon-Devtools</h5>

<p>I used Composer for the install. <code>composer global require phalcon-devtools</code> Composer is a dependency manager for PHP, and can be found at <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">https://getcomposer.org/</a>. This installs phalcon-devtools at <code>~/.composer/vender/bin</code>. Worth mentioning here, is the <code>global</code> flag. I installed this globally, so I can use it from anywhere on my computer in the future.</p>

<p>Next, in my <code>.bashrc</code> file, I created the variable <code>COMPOSERBIN</code> which I set to the path <code>COMPOSERBIN=&quot;$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Then you add the variable to your PATH, <code>export PATH=$COMPOSERBIN:$PATH</code>.</p>

<p>The final step in the <code>.bashrc</code> was to create the alias, <code>alias phalcon=$COMPOSERBIN/phalcon.php</code>,
this allows you to call the <code>phalcon</code> command from your terminal.</p>

<p>In the <code>docs-app</code>, the last change I need to make was in the <code>.env</code> file. I changed the <code>APP_URL</code> line to <code>APP_URL=http://localhost:8000</code> instead of the default url listed in the documentation.</p>

<p>Now you can just <code>cd</code> into the <code>docs-app</code> folder and type <code>phalcon serve</code>, then visit <code>http://localhost:8000</code> in your browser of choice.</p>

<p><em>A list of the available devtools commands can be found in the README.md at <a href="https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools">phalcon-devtools</a> or by typing <code>phalcon --help</code> in your terminal.</em></p>

<p>One final note, I actually cloned both the <code>docs</code> and the <code>docs-app</code> repos to my local machine. This allows me to work on the changes in the <code>docs-app</code> repo, then just copy/paste those changes into my <code>docs</code> repo, where I commit the changes.</p>
