SavvySoftWorks, LLC is proud to announce the Savadoro timer.
Savadoro is Pomodoro Technique timer, while this is still in a very early beta stage, we have big ideas for the timer long term. Including integration into Slack as well as the ability to track you and your team&amp;rsquo;s past progress.
