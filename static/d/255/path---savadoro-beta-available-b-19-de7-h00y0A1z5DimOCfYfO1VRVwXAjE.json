Including integration into Slack as well as the ability to track you and your team’s past progress.</p>\n<p>For a little background, per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">Wikipedia</a> the Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique developed in the late 1980s. Basically, you decide upon a task, then set the timer for 25 minutes. After the timer expires you take a short 3-5 minute break, and then repeat. after 4 times through the cycle you take a longer 15-20 minute break.</p>\n<p>This technique helps you stay on task as it creates specific periods of focus on a designated task. It also helps you avoid the proverbial “rabbit hole” of getting lost in a specific problem for too long, as the timer will interupt you at the designated time. Giving your brain a break or allowing you a pause to seek help.</p>\n<p>The timer itself is free for you to try, and is available for download on GitHub. <a href=\"https://github.com/SavvySoftWorksLLC/savadoro/releases/tag/v0.2.2\">https://github.com/SavvySoftWorksLLC/savadoro/releases/tag/v0.2.2</a></p>\n<p>Let us know what you think!</p>\n<p><strong>To note:</strong></p>\n<p>On Windows, Savadoro installs correctly, but does not create a Start Menu item. You can find it via search and create your own desktop shortcut.</p>\n<p><em>Sorry at this time we only have Mac and Windows versions available. Though Ubuntu will be coming soon!</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Savadoro Beta Available","date":"August 24, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/savadoro-beta-available/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/setting-up-phalcon-phps-docs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting Up Phalcon PHPs Docs","author":"Gary A.
