It was a small contribution, but nevertheless it felt nice, and it was a great way to start being an open source contributor. This post is basically just to document my experience setting up the <code class=\"language-text\">docs</code> and the <code class=\"language-text\">docs-app</code> for <a href=\"https://phalconphp.com/\">PhalconPHP</a>. <em>To note, I am using 2015 MacBookPro running macOS Sierra</em>.</p>\n<p>I started by following the setup guide at <a href=\"https://blog.phalconphp.com/post/helping-with-documentation\">https://blog.phalconphp.com/post/helping-with-documentation</a>. Which worked really well and it got me close, but there were a few tweaks I needed to make to get things running on my end.</p>\n<p>The main difference between the conventional setup and the way I did it was, not using Nanobox to serve the <code class=\"language-text\">docs-app</code>. I tried a couple of times, but it just wasn’t working out for me. <em>I did use it for the deploy step though.</em> What I did, with the help of friend, boss, and Phalcon core team member <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulSCoder\">Paul Scarrone</a>, was install <a href=\"https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools\">phalcon-devtools</a> instead. This allowed me to run the app via a local development server instead.</p>\n<p>So, onto the good stuff…\\</p>\n<h3>Installing Phalcon-Devtools</h3>\n<p>I used Composer for the install. <code class=\"language-text\">composer global require phalcon-devtools</code> Composer is a dependency manager for PHP, and can be found at <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">https://getcomposer.org/</a>. This installs phalcon-devtools at <code class=\"language-text\">~/.composer/vender/bin</code>. Worth mentioning here, is the <code class=\"language-text\">global</code> flag. I installed this globally, so I can use it from anywhere on my computer in the future.</p>\n<p>Next, in my <code class=\"language-text\">.bashrc</code> file, I created the variable <code class=\"language-text\">COMPOSERBIN</code> which I set to the path <code class=\"language-text\">COMPOSERBIN=&quot;$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>Then you add the variable to your PATH, <code class=\"language-text\">export PATH=$COMPOSERBIN:$PATH</code>.</p>\n<p>The final step in the <code class=\"language-text\">.bashrc</code> was to create the alias, <code class=\"language-text\">alias phalcon=$COMPOSERBIN/phalcon.php</code>,\nthis allows you to call the <code class=\"language-text\">phalcon</code> command from your terminal.</p>\n<p>In the <code class=\"language-text\">docs-app</code>, the last change I need to make was in the <code class=\"language-text\">.env</code> file. I changed the <code class=\"language-text\">APP_URL</code> line to <code class=\"language-text\">APP_URL=http://localhost:8000</code> instead of the default url listed in the documentation.</p>\n<p>Now you can just <code class=\"language-text\">cd</code> into the <code class=\"language-text\">docs-app</code> folder and type <code class=\"language-text\">phalcon serve</code>, then visit <code class=\"language-text\">http://localhost:8000</code> in your browser of choice.</p>\n<p><em>A list of the available devtools commands can be found in the README.md at <a href=\"https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools\">phalcon-devtools</a> or by typing <code class=\"language-text\">phalcon --help</code> in your terminal.</em></p>\n<p>One final note, I actually cloned both the <code class=\"language-text\">docs</code> and the <code class=\"language-text\">docs-app</code> repos to my local machine. This allows me to work on the changes in the <code class=\"language-text\">docs-app</code> repo, then just copy/paste those changes into my <code class=\"language-text\">docs</code> repo, where I commit the changes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Setting Up Phalcon PHPs Docs","date":"September 10, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/setting-up-phalcon-phps-docs/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/savadoro-beta-available/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Savadoro Beta Available","author":"Gary A.
