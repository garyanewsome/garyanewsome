If you have read any blog posts by other developers, or listened to any podcasts, you have likely heard the term 'Imposter Syndrome'.  Per wikipedia:

Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a term coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes referring to high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

Now everyone talks ad nauseum about Imposter Syndrome and rightfully so. As a developer just starting out along this career path, it seems I encounter this at least weekly. In fact the point of this post is to tell you about my experiences with this and to share my favorite day of the week. **Thursday!**.

On Thursday, I meet with [Paul Scarrone](https://twitter.com/PaulSCoder), Lead Developer and my boss at [SavvySoftWorks](http://savvysoftworks.com). This is always a great learning experience, a chance to talk shop, and catch up with a friend. It is also a chance to hear my mentor and a senior level developer talk about everything that went wrong with his week, and all the things he struggled with.

The later part helps set my mind at ease. Yes I likely bumbled through a few things all week, spent too much time working to figure out something out at somepoint, but at the end of the day, so did he. More importantly so did we all. It is the nature of the beast. Whatever problem you are solving, will take time. Especially when it is a problem you previously have not solved.

So I tell you, Imposter Syndrome is real, it effects developers at every level. Young developers can feel it often, and even senior level developers can feel the pain as well. We all spend time scratching our heads, and the hardest part is realizing we are not alone, this is not unique, and not outside of the norms.

I cannot recall who it was I heard say it, but the quote has stuck with me, “If you haven’t experienced Imposter Syndrome you aren’t a real developer.” So hear I sit writing the sixth trillionth version of Imposter Syndrome is real, hoping other young developers may eventually see this and it will help put their mind at ease. Truthfully, I hope to set my own mind at ease blathering about it. As a young developer, working mostly remotely, this is a trap I personally can fall into all to easily and all to often.

We all have to push forward, through the growing pains, through the pains of feeling like an absolute failure, or the feelings as if we do not belong.

Programming is hard.
