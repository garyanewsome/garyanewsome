  SavvySoftWorks, LLC is proud to announce the Savadoro timer.
</p>

<p>
  Savadoro is Pomodoro Technique timer, while this is still in a very early beta stage, we have big ideas for the timer long term. Including integration into Slack as well as the ability to track you and your team's past progress.
</p>

<p>
  For a little background, per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) the Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique developed in the late 1980s. Basically, you decide upon a task, then set the timer for 25 minutes. After the timer expires you take a short 3-5 minute break, and then repeat. after 4 times through the cycle you take a longer 15-20 minute break.
</p>

<p>
  This technique helps you stay on task as it creates specific periods of focus on a designated task. It also helps you avoid the proverbial "rabbit hole" of getting lost in a specific problem for too long, as the timer will interupt you at the designated time. Giving your brain a break or allowing you a pause to seek help.
</p>

<p>
  The timer itself is free for you to try, and is available for download on GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/SavvySoftWorksLLC/savadoro/releases/tag/v0.2.2" target="_blank">https://github.com/SavvySoftWorksLLC/savadoro/releases/tag/v0.2.2</a>

<p>
  Let us know what you think!
</p>

<p><strong>To note:</strong></p>

<p>
  On Windows, Savadoro installs correctly, but does not create a Start Menu item. You can find it via search and create your own desktop shortcut.
